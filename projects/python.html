                <a href="https://gitfront.io/r/user-9213492/CNYwSKXbkUCK/CSCI-715-Distributed-Computing/tree/Project%20-%20n-body%20solver/Submission/">Parallel n-body solver</a>
                - Programmed a distributed (parallel) n-body solver using 
                mpi4py (Message-Passing Interface for Python). Solves the 
                problem of computing the positions and velocities of n 
                particles at short time intervals given the simultaneous 
                gravitational attraction between them. Each CPU core is assigned
				some of the particles and the positions/forces are sent to
				each other using message passing. Implemented both a 
                basic solver and a more efficient one that utilizes Newton's
                third law so that only half of the amount of forces must
                be communicated between CPU cores. In fact, a "ring pass"
				(considering the processes be in a cycle) allows for minimal
				data communication and thus fastest computing time.

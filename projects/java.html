                <p>
                    Reads lines from an input file and parses them into words. 
                    If they are valid words (contain only letters), they are
                    added to a GUI that has a menubar with 6 text areas. They
                    are put into a particular text area based on their first
                    letter (one of the 5 vowels or consonant). They are
                    displayed sorted using a TreeMap. Individual words can also
                    be added using the menu afterwards.

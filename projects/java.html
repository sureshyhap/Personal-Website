                <p>
                    Simulated a Bunny Assembly Line with Java Thread 
                    Concurrency. Several Manufacturer objects creates bunny
                    parts and load them to their corresponding Truck object 
                    which delivers the parts to an AssemblyLine object for 
                    production. All these parts operate concurrently taking full 
                    advantage of several Java Thread methods to synchronize the 
                    different objects operations together using busy waits when 
                    a wait is needed.

                <p>
                    Similar to the previous project except instead of using busy
                    waiting to block a process until a condition is met, wait
                    and signals (P and V) on counting and binary semaphores are
                    used to implement thread synchronization.

                <p>
                    Reads lines from an input file and parses them into words. 
                    If they are valid words (contain only letters), they are
                    added to a GUI that has a menubar with 6 text areas. They
                    are put into a particular text area based on their first
                    letter (one of the 5 vowels or consonant). They are
                    displayed sorted using a TreeMap. Individual words can also
                    be added using the menu afterwards.

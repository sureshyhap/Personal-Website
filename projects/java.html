                <p>
                    Implemented a compiler that detects errors for a subset of
                    the Pascal programming language. Includes both lexical and
                    syntax analysis.

                <p>
                    Simulated a Bunny Assembly Line with Java Thread 
                    Concurrency. Several Manufacturer objects creates bunny
                    parts and load them to their corresponding Truck object 
                    which delivers the parts to an AssemblyLine object for 
                    production. All these parts operate concurrently taking full 
                    advantage of several Java Thread methods to synchronize the 
                    different objects operations together using busy waits when 
                    a wait is needed.

                <p>
                    Similar to the previous project except instead of using busy
                    waiting to block a process until a condition is met, wait
                    and signals (P and V) on counting and binary semaphores are
                    used to implement thread synchronization.

                <p>
                    Performed image enhancement by computing an output image that has been smoothed by averaging operations. A simple averaging of a pixel's 5 by 5
                    (for instance) "neighborhood" can significantly remove noise both internal and external to the object. However, this smoothing can "blur" important
                    features like corners. A corner-preserving averaging can be done at the cost of additional processing to keep corners very much intact.

                <p>
                    Extracted image edges given binary object pixel files. Used the zero-crossing edge detector to find outlines of objects. Basically, a mask is applied
                    to local neighborhoods throughout the image and then regions of nonpositive values are zeroed out. Subsequently positive values with at least one
                    zero in their neighborhood  are considered to be part of an edge.

                <p>
                    Analyzed "zones" (may be regions of text or non-text regions) of a document containing heterogeneous regions of information. So called projection
                    profiles were tabulated that can be used to determine if a zone is of text and if so whether the language is written horizontally or vertically.

                <p>
                    Simulated a Turing Machine that reads in a set of transitions 
                    that define a transition function and changes the input to
                    the correct output after processing. Tested with a Turing
                    machine definition that adds two binary numbers. Also checks
                    if the program will halt in a given number of steps.

                <p>
                    Reads lines from an input file and parses them into words. 
                    If they are valid words (contain only letters), they are
                    added to a GUI that has a menubar with 6 text areas. They
                    are put into a particular text area based on their first
                    letter (one of the 5 vowels or consonant). They are
                    displayed sorted using a TreeMap. Individual words can also
                    be added using the menu afterwards.
